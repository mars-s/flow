# Changelog

All notable changes to Flow. This file is the **source of truth for the release
notes shown in the in-app updater**: [`scripts/release.ts`](scripts/release.ts)
extracts the section whose heading matches the version being released
(`MARKETING_VERSION`) and publishes it next to the update, so Sparkle shows it in
the update prompt.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Add a new
`## [<version>]` section at the top for each release, matching the version you
set in the Xcode project.

Write release notes for the final product users receive, not the development
history. When a feature is still unreleased, fold its fixes and refinements into
the original feature bullet instead of adding separate entries for them.

## [unreleased]

- Fork from Waku as Flow, a personal task manager. The entries below this
  point are Waku's release history prior to the fork and are kept for
  provenance, not as Flow release notes.
- Capture a task in plain language — "take out laundry 8am tomorrow"
  becomes a task with a real date and time attached, editable before you
  save. Place it in Inbox, Today, Upcoming, Anytime, or Someday, and break
  it into one level of subtasks.
- A read-only glance at your Mac's own Calendar app: connect it from
  Settings, see today's events alongside your tasks, and browse
  Day/Week/Month/Year views in the Calendar tab. Flow never creates,
  edits, or deletes anything in your calendar.
- Fully usable from the keyboard: capture, complete, reschedule, delete,
  and undo without touching the mouse.

<!-- Draft, not yet reviewed for an actual release: written to close a
     gap (this section previously had nothing describing any of Flow's
     shipped functionality, only the fork note), in plain factual terms
     rather than as polished marketing copy. Worth a pass before this
     ships in a real Sparkle update dialog. -->
